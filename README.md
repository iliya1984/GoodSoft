Here I put, a few sample projects for microservice backend, writen in Spring Boot

Currently the solution contains
  - Two web based microservice projects
  - Two message broker consumers
  - Few infrastructure modules

Technologies used are following:
  - Java Spring Boot as the programming framework
  - MongoDB as a primary database
  - Elastic search as a database for CQRS reads
  - RabbitMQ as a message broker
